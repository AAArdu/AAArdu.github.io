This writing includes some tools and website which can help us study adversarial ML 

Tools
------
Up to now, many tools and framworks have been created to assist the process of analyzing adversarial machine learning. Here I recommend some of these:
* [cleverhans](https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans)
If you have read some paper about adversarial ML, you would find many familiar names in the contributors of this project. It's a heavyweight work!
* [foolbox](https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox)
* [adversarial-robustness-toolbox](https://github.com/IBM/adversarial-robustness-toolbox)

Website
------
There are some website which show information about the confrontation between attack and defense. We can get a straight view that now defense is much weak than attack in the adversarial game of ML.
* [Robust Vison Benchmark](https://robust.vision/benchmark/leaderboard/)
* [RobustML](https://www.robust-ml.org/)  

We can utilize above resources to analyze rubostness of our nerual network model or build new defense. Besides, I'm trying to implement my own lib ———— [adversarialML](https://github.com/AAArdu/adversarialML). Unlike object-oritended, in this lib, I want to build attack or defense methods in a simpler way, like function style. By doing this, I think I can be more familiar with this field and can smooth my future research experiment. Welcome contributors! :)
